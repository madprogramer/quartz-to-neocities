# Neocities to Quartz

This is a fork of https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/ where I combine some techniques from [Jonathan Chang](https://jonathanchang.org/blog/deploying-your-static-site-to-neocities-using-github-actions/) to deploy a slightly-modified quartz site to Neocities. 

https://madpro.neocities.org/ to be precise.
