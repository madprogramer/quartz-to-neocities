## Why?

Favorites or Bookmarks bars have been around for ages as a shortcut for people to save webpages they want to come back to. 

But today, I would say the connotation of having a favorites bar has changed. Today, those who continue to keep Favorites Bars are those opposed to search engines, social media, automation and recommendation-based browsing. Those who want a private alternative where they feel more in-control of where they are going to and from.

[[Privacy]] is a powerful word. Perhaps, _too_ powerful. 

We often like to think of _the intimate_ as _the private_. 

However, when things get too private instead of _personal_, they can become constraining. A prison of the mind, as it were.

I have a lot of personal passions which I have turned private. And that has rendered those experiences invisible or less visible to other people. Even to [[My Amazing Friends|my friends]] and the other people precious to me.

If anything, in accessing my sites _directly_ from a favorites bar, I have through absence of input helped rig most automated systems to believe that these corners of the internet are _unpopular anyway_. And I am certainly not alone. Here we are, together, prisoners of the mind; trapped in our own worlds and having trapped those worlds from the other nations and communities.

Favorites Bar is my protest project to gradually make my favorites bar more personal, through making it more visible. To set it free.
