I currently reside in the cozy city of Copenhagen in Denmark.

* If you ever come up here North, we would love to see you at a [SpilBar](https://www.facebook.com/groups/148420778510244) event!
* My local hackerspace is https://itunderground.dk/
* Yes, we do get the Northern Lights, just [very late at night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rv5G9cMuYLc)!
