[[WIP]].

I currently reside in the cozy city of [[Copenhagen]] in [[Denmark]].

* If you like [[Board Games]], check out https://bastardcafe.dk/
* If you ever come up here North, we would love to see you at a [[SpilBar]] event! That's an enjoyable [[Gamedev]] gathering!
* My local hackerspace is https://itunderground.dk/ and I guess https://cryptohagen.dk/index_en.html isn't half bad either.
* Yes, we do get the Northern Lights, just [very late at night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rv5G9cMuYLc)!
