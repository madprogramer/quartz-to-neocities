Indeed everything2 is a sequel to an earlier site called everything. everything was, the less successful sister-site of [Slashdot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdot) and is sometimes spoken of as a predecessor to the likes of Wikipedia or Urban Dictionary.

everything2 is a conservative continuation of everything that sought to keep things retro. This makes everything2 ideal for diverse topics ranging from [Dejap Translations](https://everything2.com/title/Dejap+Translations) to [Icelandic noun cases and declensions](https://everything2.com/title/Icelandic+noun+cases+and+declensions).

If nothing else, everything and everything2 are interesting case studies to understand the origins of [[eksisozluk]].
