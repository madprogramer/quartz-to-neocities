Rom Hacking is when we hack old games into new things!

It is distinct from [[Hacking]], but there is an overlap in culture.

This page is a [[WIP]].

January 2014: I developed [FOBBY](https://forum.starmen.net/forum/Community/PKHack/FOBBY-CoilSnake-Now-with-GUI/page/1) for [CoilSnake](https://pk-hack.github.io/CoilSnake/).
2013-2016: Misc. Earthbound Hacks on Starmen.net and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6pakyXFdifjVvbhqPSXkj6zApsJaw1f8)
2020 onwards: I mostly lurk around the PK Hack and Starmen.net Discord Servers. I also have tried to go on https://www.romhacking.net/ and fanslation communities more.
