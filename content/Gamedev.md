Some people play games, some people make games. Gamedev is short for Game developer or Game development. I prefer to call myself a gamemaker, but I heard [that name was taken](https://gamemaker.io/en).

#### 2024:
* https://github.com/madprogramer/Caricatures-Comics-Cartoons/tree/main
#### 2023:
* No new games this year! ¯\\_(⁰͡ ͜ʖ⁰͡ )_/¯
* I have been modding Victoria 3, the only mod I have publicly released is my mod of the [Skyrim Intro](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2949175547).
* I have, however, written on gamedev for ITU Copenhagen's [lowscoremag](https://lowscore.dk/about/):
	* [Companies and Artists](https://lowscore.dk/companies-and-artists/) 
	* [CAVE STORY: A GAME FOR BOTH SPEEDRUNNERS AND COMPLETIONISTS](https://lowscore.dk/cave-story-a-game-for-both-speedrunners-and-completionists/ "Cave Story: A Game for Both Speedrunners and Completionists")
* I am helping a friend make an [ULTRAKILL](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1229490/ULTRAKILL) card game, let's see how that will turn out.
* [[SpilBar]].
#### 2022:
* I saved up enough to go to [Paradox CON '22](https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/pdxcon). This has probably been the biggest "gaming" event I have ever attended. It was great for meeting developers, the Swedish game scene, modders, livestreamers and other cool folks.
	* Unlike some people, I am a fan of the new Victoria 3 and am actually working on modding.
	* Something, something [Kaiserreich](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kaiserreich/).
* [[SpilBar]]
* Playtesting + Variants for [Routers](https://rpggeek.com/rpg/78636/routers-rpg)
#### 2021:
* I got into [[Board Games]] again.
#### 2020
* I co-hosted [Stranger Jam (19-26 June 2020)](https://itch.io/jam/strangerjam2020). In Stranger Jam participants were only allowed to team up with people they hadn’t met before, hence people who were complete “strangers”. Stranger Jam was a unique twist on the usual game jam formula, allowing participants to collaborate with new people, instead of only competing against one another.

  * 19 games were submitted by over 40 participants. A [playthrough of Stranger Jam](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjG0A3RTjh1Ti58VQ9hNe1alV4P7opc-N)submissions is available as a YouTube Playlist, courtesy of _The Wandering Shadow_.
#### Works prior to 2016
* Misc. Gamemaker, Unity projects that didn't go anywhere. I will someday get around to uploading some early sprites and music I did during this time.
* Before [Roblox](https://www.roblox.com/) there was [Atmosphir](https://atmosphir.fandom.com/wiki/Atmosphir). I designed a ton of levels there before it shut down. I haven't ever been nearly as invested in Roblox but I do have sympathies for both communities.

In the beginning: I was terrified of games growing up. Watching cartoons or reading stories, that was easy. Every character played their part in the story and I was an observer. But games were different. They brought a serious fear of agency within me. When I defeated the enemies was I killing them? When I failed was I dooming the hero? Those questions haunted me while playing and in my nightmares as I slept.

I only embraced games as a form of escapism thanks to a good friend who `convert`ed me. He taught me to see games like I saw cartoons or stories, as escapes from the confines of reality. Many people I know are afraid to admit they like games out of seeming immature or childish. But as someone who has had a legitimate fear of games, I implore you to reconsider. Find the games you like, learn to appreciate them.

My form of appreciation was to become a maker of games myself. But said friend who originally converted me to games could never partner with me as a developer, out of self-doubt. We spent our days playing through games and critiquing them that it made it impossible for him to be satisfied with anything he made, as he would recognise it as subpar.

We are not born masters. We become them. That's why to me today, it's easier for me to deal with the agency of me having made flawed games and sharing them with people than it was for me to pick up a game and 'express myself' many years prior.
