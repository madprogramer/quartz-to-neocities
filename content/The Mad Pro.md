I go by many names: The Mad Programer, The Mad, The Pro, madpr0gramer, *The Mad Pro*...

This page is a [[WIP]]. I'm migrating from https://madprogramer.github.io/, so some details may be missing.

----------------

Originally, the name `The Mad Programer` was a name I crafted as my persona in the [[Rom Hacking]] scene. It ended up becoming my alias on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheMadProgramer), [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2089784/madprogramer), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@themadpro); you name it!

Of course I don't just do rom hacking and coding nowadays, so I have opted to abbreviate my name as `The Mad Pro`. So, my online presence mostly lives as `The Mad Pro`.

Cool `Madpro` Facts:
* Besides the rom hacking, I have been a [[Gamedev|game development ]]nerd for at least a decade.
* I am _probably_ most known for my involvement with the Archivist scene. I am one of the founders of https://datahorde.org/.
* I am a (mostly) retired competitive programer: Find me on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/themadprogramer), [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/users/ahmet-akkoc) and [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/themadpr0gramer). I am mostly committing to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/themadprogramer), nowadays, and that has a focus on Data Science and much less so on algorithms.
* My secret-not-secret passion in linguistics. Notably, I administer the [Cult of Linguists](https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/users/17465/madprogramer) group on Quora.
* I like collecting [[Pixel Art]].
* Amateur baker 🧑🏼‍🍳.
