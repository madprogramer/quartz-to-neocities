I go by many names: The Mad Programer, The Mad, The Pro, madpr0gramer, *The Mad Pro*...

-------------------

Originally, the name `The Mad Programer` was a name I crafted as my persona in the [[Rom Hacking]] scene. It ended up becoming my alias on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheMadProgramer), [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2089784/madprogramer), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@themadpro); you name it!

Of course I don't just do rom hacking and coding nowadays, so I have opted to abbreviate my name as `The Mad Pro`. So, my online presence mostly lives as `The Mad Pro`.
