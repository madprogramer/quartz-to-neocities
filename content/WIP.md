Work-in-Progress.

I have very fond memories of this abbreviation. It was especially common in the [[Rom Hacking|romhacking]] community, used to label drafts or prototypes as WIP. It really sends the signal to people that constructive criticism is not only open but anticipated, in recognising the work is far from complete.

We should try to use it more often (^\_^)
